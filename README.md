# üß† Code Comment Classifier VSCode Extension

This VSCode extension helps developers **understand and organize code comments** by automatically classifying them into meaningful types using an LLM (Large Language Model). It's especially useful for large codebases where navigating and interpreting comments quickly becomes a challenge.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note for user study participants**: The classification backend is **disabled** for this version. All comments have been **pre-classified**‚Äîyou don‚Äôt need to run any classification commands.



## ‚úîÔ∏èHow to Start

1. Click the following  button to create an online environment using github codespace

   <a href="https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=YorHaaa/ClassiCode" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
     <img src="https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg" alt="Open in GitHub Codespaces">
   </a>

2. Choose a **4 cores 16GB machine** and create a codespace cloud server for you own.

3. Wait for all libraries in the environment to be loaded successfully and **press F5** on your keyboard to start extensions debugging mode. (**Ignore all notifications that appear in vscode, no need to install any other extensions appear in the vscode**)

4. Then you will see a new editor pop up in vscode, which is used to select the project to which this plugin should be applied. **All subsequent operations in this experiment are completed on this editor.** 

   At this point, the plugin has been successfully run, and you can see the clone repository button in the explorer option in the side bar. 

   Through this button, we can **clone the project prepared for this experiment locally and apply our plugin**.

5. After clicking the `clone repository` button, you might be asked to log in to your GitHub account

6. After logging in, you need to click the `clone repository` again, copy this link into the input box

   Don't change anything, just click `Select as Repository Destination`

   Then you will see that the plug-in has been successfully applied to the project required for this experiment.

| **Summary**     | Provides a quick overview or high-level idea    |
| **Ownership**   | Indicates authorship or maintenance info        |
| **Expand**      | Gives deeper or background explanation          |
| **Usage**       | Explains how to use a function, parameter, etc. |
| **Pointer**     | Refers to related locations in the codebase     |
| **Deprecation** | Marks outdated or obsolete code sections        |
| **Rational**    | Explains the reasoning behind a decision        |



You may find that multiple tags or information types can be applied to a paragraph within a comment
